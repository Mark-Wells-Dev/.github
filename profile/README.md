**Systems Engineer | Rust | Computational Science**

PhD in Astrophysics turned Rust systems engineer. I build high-performance tools at the intersection of Computational Science and developer productivity.

Currently building:
- **[OmniDSP](https://github.com/mark-wells-dev/OmniDSP):** Modular signal processing.
- **[HedgeMaze](https://github.com/mark-wells-dev/HedgeMaze):** Schema-driven knowledge management.
- **[Themis](https://github.com/mark-wells-dev/Themis):** CLI theme management.

I bring scientific rigor to open source architecture—when I'm not wrangling my two kids.
